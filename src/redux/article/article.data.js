        title: 'Pager, Discman and Game Boy: This is the tech we used in 1995',
        summary: `We didn't just carry different gadgets 25 years ago, we carried a lot more of them.`,
        text: `The year was 1995. Nirvana played on the radio, Toy Story was a hit movie, and as Netscape had its IPO and Microsoft released Internet Explorer, the World Wide Web boomed like a supernova. People went online, buying books on Amazon, searching for content on Yahoo and reading about it all on a new website called CNET. As part of CNET's 25th anniversary, we've spent the last month sharing with you how the internet, the technology industry and CNET itself have profoundly progressed over the last quarter of a century. But it's not just our online experience, the people driving it and the technologies powering it that have changed. The personal gadgets we use today barely resemble those from the mid-1990s, and most of them are now combined in our phones. So strap on your pager, grab your Game Boy and make sure your camera has enough film: We're taking a wistful and sometimes regrettable look back.`,

        title: 'How to watch SpaceX launch a Space Force GPS satellite to orbit today',
        summary: `Elon Musk's company is aiming for its third launch since sending NASA astronauts to the space station on May 30 and is also trying for a new first.`,
        text: `SpaceX had its most active year so far in 2018 with 21 launches. It's now on pace to eclipse that mark in 2020, perhaps hitting 38 launches for the year if its plans pan out. The company hopes to continue packing its calendar with more lift-offs, aiming for 70 missions in 2023, according to a draft filing with the Federal Aviation Administration earlier this year. Many of the launches will be Starlink missions, as SpaceX looks to put tens of thousands of its small satellites in orbit this decade. The company has also begun conducting ride-share launches, making room for a few commercial payloads alongside a batch of Starlink birds. The next Starlink launch is set to be the second Starlink ride share, this time with two Earth-observing microsatellites for Black Sky, a company that provides high-def satellite imagery. SpaceX is trying expand the size of its growing constellation to nearly 600 satellites and closer to the threshold of 800 flying routers that Musk has said would allow for limited broadband service to begin.  `,

        title: `The coronavirus can't derail 5G's global expansion`,
        summary: `The pandemic has caused hiccups in some regions, but the super-fast wireless tech keeps rolling out`,
        text: `he virus, which causes a pneumonia-like disease called COVID-19, quickly spread across the globe, causing cities and entire countries to issue lockdowns to slow its advance. China, where COVID-19 was first detected in late 2019, shut down first, jamming up production of iPhones and other products. The rest of the world soon followed suit, and the global economy all but ground to a halt. "In our lifetimes we've never seen a faster economic collapse," Strategy Analytics analyst Ken Hyers said. The result is a shattering of the buoyant optimism of just six months ago. Millions of people are out of work, and the world has recorded over 10 million COVID-19 infections. But even if the coronavirus has slowed down the rollout of 5G in heavily hit areas such as the US, it's not going to stop 5G's progress.`,

        title: 'Uber wants riders to sanitize the backseat to help fight coronavirus',
        summary: `The ride-hailing company says drivers in select cities will now have a steady supply of Clorox disinfectant wipes for everyone to use.`,
        text: `"As we navigate a new normal and cities continue to reopen, we want all Uber users to travel with confidence. That starts with clean cars," Uber wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. "Cleanliness is a shared responsibility and riders should also be making an effort to sanitize the frequently touched areas in the back of the car to help create a cleaner environment for themselves, the driver, and the next passenger."
        Last month, Uber released a new version of its app focused on safety guidelines around the novel coronavirus. In the updated app, drivers and passengers are required to agree to a checklist of items before each trip, such as confirming they're wearing a face mask, keeping the windows rolled down when possible and having no one sitting in the front seat.
        The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people avoid sitting in confined spaces with strangers, such as a car, to lower the risk of coronavirus infection.
        Uber drivers say they've experienced a difficult time during the pandemic. Many have reported coming down with COVID-19 and at least five are known to have died from the illness.`,
